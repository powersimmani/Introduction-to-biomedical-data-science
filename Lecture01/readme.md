## 📚 Key Topics

### Part 1: Atomic and Molecular Foundations

**Atoms and Bonding**
- **Electron orbitals**: s, p, d, f orbital shapes and biological elements (CHNOPS)
- **Chemical bonds**: Covalent (50-200 kcal/mol), ionic (5-10 kcal/mol), hydrogen bonds (1-5 kcal/mol), van der Waals (<1 kcal/mol)
- **Water properties**: Polarity, high heat capacity, solvent capabilities, hydrophobic effect

**Biological Macromolecules**
- **Amino acids**: 20 standard amino acids, classification by properties, chirality (L-amino acids), ionization states
- **Protein structure**: Primary (sequence), Secondary (α-helix, β-sheet), Tertiary (3D folding), Quaternary (subunit assembly)
- **DNA structure**: Watson-Crick base pairing (A=T, G≡C), double helix parameters, major/minor grooves

### Part 2: Central Dogma (DNA → RNA → Protein)

**DNA Replication**
- **Semiconservative replication**: Each strand serves as template
- **DNA polymerase III**: 5' → 3' synthesis, error rate ~1 in 10⁷
- **Leading vs lagging strand**: Continuous vs discontinuous synthesis with Okazaki fragments

**Transcription**
- **RNA polymerase**: Promoter recognition and elongation
- **RNA processing**: 5' cap, 3' poly(A) tail, splicing removes introns
- **Gene regulation**: Transcription factors, enhancers, silencers, chromatin remodeling

**Translation**
- **Ribosome**: Large (60S) and small (40S) subunits in eukaryotes
- **Genetic code**: 64 codons encoding 20 amino acids, universal and degenerate
- **tRNA**: Anticodon pairing, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases

**Regulation and RNA Biology**
- **Epigenetics**: DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin states
- **RNA types**: mRNA (protein-coding), tRNA (adapter), rRNA (ribosomal), miRNA/siRNA (regulatory), lncRNA (long non-coding)
- **Protein folding**: Anfinsen's principle, chaperones, misfolding diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's)

### Part 3: Cellular Systems

**Cell Structure**
- **Membrane**: Lipid bilayer, fluid mosaic model, transport mechanisms
- **Organelles**: Nucleus (gene expression), ER (protein/lipid synthesis), Mitochondria (ATP production), Golgi (protein modification)

**Cell Communication and Metabolism**
- **Signaling**: GPCR and RTK receptors, second messengers (cAMP, Ca²⁺), kinase cascades
- **Metabolism**: Glycolysis (2 ATP, 2 NADH), TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (~30-32 ATP total)
- **Energy transfer**: ATP structure and hydrolysis (ΔG°' = -7.3 kcal/mol)

**Cell Division and Differentiation**
- **Cell cycle**: G1, S (DNA replication), G2, M (mitosis) phases with checkpoints
- **Apoptosis**: Intrinsic (mitochondrial) and extrinsic (death receptor) pathways, caspase cascade
- **Stem cells**: Totipotent → pluripotent → multipotent → unipotent hierarchy

**Hands-on Skills**
- **PyMOL**: Loading PDB structures, visualization options, distance measurements, ray tracing
- **PDB Database**: Search strategies, structure quality metrics, active site identification, AlphaFold integration
